The manuscript explores the pivotal role of predictive models and their transformative impact on the field of 
healthcare within the context of blood-related infections and offers a **living review** of the machine-learning 
techniques that have been used for the detection and prediction of bacteremia, bloodstream infections, and sepsis. 
By delving into these methods, we aim to shed light on their efficacy, potential limitations, and the intricacies 
of their integration into clinical practice. In doing so, we will undertake a critical comparison with the existing 
clinical scoring systems, illuminating both the novel insights provided by machine learning and the practical 
considerations essential for their successful implementation in real-world healthcare scenarios.
